        <p>
          In 1989, Joe Dever in response to the massive success of Steve Jackson's
          <i>F.I.S.T.</i> (the first ever interactive play by phone roleplaying game), launched his
          own Lone Wolf game for his interactive phone game system &ndash; <i>PhoneQuest</i>. To
          play the game, you dialed a number on your landline telephone. A narrative voice presented
          a story with a selection of choices for you. All of this was accompanied by cinematic
          music and immersive sound effects. One of these adventures was called
          <i>Fortress of Doom</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now in 2023 the time has come to reenvision Joe Dever's original concept and release a
          game for smartphones and tablets &ndash; a new game incorporating 360 surround sound and
          the latest app technology but still faithful to the original. This new interactive
          adventure returns to the glory days of Lone Wolf and fantasy roleplaying games, making it
          the most immersive audio game experience ever. <i>The Fortress of Death</i> is a brand new
          and official Lone Wolf adventure, written by August Hahn and inspired by the setting in
          <i>Fortress of Doom</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The funds to produce <i>The Fortress of Death</i> were secured with a Kickstarter campaign
          in late 2023. The Sound Realms team is now busy at work completing the full game, set for
          a release in the Spring of 2025. Meanwhile, a short demo of the beginning of the adventure
          is available to try out for free in the Sound Realms app. Enter, if you dare,
          <i><span class="bold">The Fortress of Death!</span></i>
