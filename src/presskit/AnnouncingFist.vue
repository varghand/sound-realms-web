          <h1>Sound Realms Announces The Return of Steve Jackson's F.I.S.T.</h1>

          <p>
            In 1988 you could pick up your telephone, dial the <strong>F.I.S.T.</strong> number and
            you were immediately connected to a medieval fantasy world of magic, monsters and great
            riches to be plundered. A world where <i>YOU</i> were a heroic adventurer embarking on a
            quest for fame and fortune. <strong>F.I.S.T.</strong> was the first interactive phone
            game ever.
          </p>
          <p>
            The creatures and deadly traps that awaited you in Castle Mammon were brought to life
            with dramatic sound effects and new gaming techniques. You could hear the roar of the
            Flesh Eater as your sword bites, the sizzle of the fireball bursting towards you, the
            chinking of the many gold pieces you could find in the Demon Prince's underground
            dungeon. <i>YOU</i> made the decisions simply by using your telephone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first <strong>F.I.S.T.</strong> adventure featuring the world of
            <i>Castle Mammon &mdash; Lair of the Demon Prince</i>, created by the fertile mind of
            games master <strong>Steve Jackson</strong> (co-founder of Games Workshop and the
            Fighting Fantasy gamebook series), now returns as it was released in 1988, audio and
            gameplay intact, but adapted for iOS and Android using the
            <strong>Sound Realms</strong> system.
          </p>
          <p><strong>GET READY FOR F.I.S.T., THE RETURN!</strong></p>

          <h3>About Fighting Fantasy</h3>

          <p>
            Fighting Fantasy is a series of single-player role-playing gamebooks created by Steve
            Jackson and Ian Livingstone. The first volume in the series was published in 1982. The
            series distinguished itself by mixing Choose Your Own Adventure-style storytelling with
            a dice-based role-playing element included within the books themselves. In 1988 F.I.S.T.
            was introduced by Steve Jackson: a radio drama version of the Fighting Fantasy novels,
            where the outcome of the story could be affected by choices the user made using a
            touch-tone telephone.
