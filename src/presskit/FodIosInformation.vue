          <h1>Important Update for iOS Users</h1>
          <p><i>(March 27, 2025)</i></p>

          <p>
            We regret to inform our iOS users that Apple has just issued a warning regarding certain
            guidelines we have inadvertently violated in our app. As a result, we are unable to
            release new updates until the required changes are made. This has obviously become our
            top priority, but it will take some time to address these issues and implement the
            necessary changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            This came as an unpleasant surprise, especially given that the app has been live on the
            App Store for over three years and with more than 170 updates accepted without issue.
            It's particularly unfortunate timing, just before the highly anticipated release of The
            Fortress of Death â€“ but as Murphy's Law would have it, things rarely go as planned.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are already working with Apple to resolve the issues and have asked for a temporary
            exception to allow us to release The Fortress of Death as scheduled. We are still
            waiting for their verdict in this matter, so we can't provide an exact timeline just
            yet. We will of course update you as soon as we know more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, the Android release will proceed as planned tomorrow (March 28) at
            19:00 CET.
          </p>
          <p>Thank you for your understanding and patience!</p>
