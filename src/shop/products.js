Call of Cthulhu: The Audio Investigations brings Chaosium’s legendary horror RPG to life in an immersive, audio-driven format exclusively on the Sound Realms platform. Based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, this series transforms chilling tales of cosmic horror into rich, interactive solo experiences.

The first investigation, Alone Against the Tide, takes you to the fog-drenched town of Esbury, where you have to confront something far older and more sinister than what you were sent out to investigate.

Within the game, you take on the role of an investigator of the mysterious and unknown during the 1920s. Common themes include supernatural horrors, chaos cults, forbidden knowledge and ancient civilisations pre-dating mankind.

    longDescription: `
In 1989, Joe Dever — in response to the massive success of Steve Jackson's F.I.S.T. (the first ever interactive play by phone roleplaying game) — launched his own Lone Wolf game for his interactive phone game system, PhoneQuest. To play the game, you dialled a number on your landline telephone. A narrative voice guided you through a story, offering choices along the way. All of this was accompanied by cinematic music and immersive sound effects, creating a unique and engaging experience. One of these adventures was called The Fortress of Doom.

Now the time has come to reenvision Joe Dever's original concept and take it to the next level by crafting a reimagined experience for smartphones and tablets. The Fortress of Death is an all-new, interactive adventure that brings the magic of Lone Wolf to life with cutting-edge 360-degree surround sound and the latest app technology — all while staying true to the spirit of the original. This immersive audio adventure is a tribute to the golden age of fantasy roleplaying, offering a deeply engaging experience that will transport you straight into the world of Magnamund.

The Fortress of Death is a brand-new and official Lone Wolf adventure, written by August Hahn and inspired by the iconic Fortress of Doom.

Enter, if you dare, The Fortress of Death!

    longDescription: `
In 1988 you could pick up your telephone, dial the F.I.S.T. number and you were immediately connected to a medieval fantasy world of magic, monsters and great riches to be plundered. A world where YOU were a heroic adventurer embarking on a quest for fame and fortune. F.I.S.T. was the first interactive phone game ever.

The creatures and deadly traps that awaited you in Castle Mammon were brought to life with dramatic sound effects and new gaming techniques. You could hear the roar of the Flesh Eater as your sword bites, the sizzle of the fireball bursting towards you, the chinking of the many gold pieces you could find in the Demon Prince's underground dungeon. YOU made the decisions simply by using your telephone.

The first F.I.S.T. adventure featuring the world of Castle Mammon — Lair of the Demon Prince, created by the fertile mind of games master Steve Jackson (co-founder of Games Workshop and the Fighting Fantasy gamebook series), now returns as it was released in 1988, audio and gameplay intact, but adapted for iOS and Android using the Sound Realms system.
