    longDescription: `
In 1989, Joe Dever in response to the massive success of Steve Jackson's F.I.S.T. (the first ever interactive play by phone roleplaying game), launched his own Lone Wolf game for his interactive phone game system – PhoneQuest. To play the game, you dialed a number on your landline telephone. A narrative voice presented a story with a selection of choices for you. All of this was accompanied by cinematic music and immersive sound effects. One of these adventures was called Fortress of Doom.

Now in 2023 the time has come to reenvision Joe Dever's original concept and release a game for smartphones and tablets – a new game incorporating 360 surround sound and the latest app technology but still faithful to the original. This new interactive adventure returns to the glory days of Lone Wolf and fantasy roleplaying games, making it the most immersive audio game experience ever. The Fortress of Death is a brand new and official Lone Wolf adventure, written by August Hahn and inspired by the setting in Fortress of Doom.

The funds to produce The Fortress of Death were secured with a Kickstarter campaign in late 2023. The Sound Realms team is now busy at work completing the full game, set for a release in the Spring of 2025. Meanwhile, a short demo of the beginning of the adventure is available to try out for free in the Sound Realms app. Enter, if you dare, The Fortress of Death!

Please note that this is a pre-order! The Fortress of Death will be released on March 28, 2025.`,

      "The original F.I.S.T. adventure, created by the fertile mind of Steve Jackson, now returns as it was released in 1988.",
    id: "fist",
    longDescription: `
In 1988 you could pick up your telephone, dial the F.I.S.T. number and you were immediately connected to a medieval fantasy world of magic, monsters and great riches to be plundered. A world where YOU were a heroic adventurer embarking on a quest for fame and fortune. F.I.S.T. was the first interactive phone game ever.

The creatures and deadly traps that awaited you in Castle Mammon were brought to life with dramatic sound effects and new gaming techniques. You could hear the roar of the Flesh Eater as your sword bites, the sizzle of the fireball bursting towards you, the chinking of the many gold pieces you could find in the Demon Prince's underground dungeon. YOU made the decisions simply by using your telephone.

The first F.I.S.T. adventure featuring the world of Castle Mammon — Lair of the Demon Prince, created by the fertile mind of games master Steve Jackson (co-founder of Games Workshop and the Fighting Fantasy gamebook series), now returns as it was released in 1988, audio and gameplay intact, but adapted for iOS and Android using the Sound Realms system.
