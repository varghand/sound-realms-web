          <h1>What is Sound Realms?</h1>

          <p>
            Sound Realms is a platform for interactive audio adventures from the Swedish game
            publisher of the same name. United by a passion for old school RPGs, we set out in 2020
            to craft a new way of enjoying solo adventures. We have since developed a smartphone
            application for iOS and Android which enables you to experience captivating solo
            adventures. What makes Sound Realms stand out from other RPG apps on the market is the
            fact (as implied by the name Sound Realms) that all our games are audio-based. A
            professional voice-over actor acts as your Dungeon Master and takes you through
            dangerous dungeons and mysterious temples, backed by a cinematic musical score and top
            of the line sound effects. All this is presented in a design that makes you instantly
            remember your old solo adventure books, complete with beautiful original illustrations
            and artwork. In time, Sound Realms will be expanded to include not only fantasy, but
            also scifi, horror, and post-apocalyptic games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sound Realms aim to deliver immersive and captivating experiences to the paperback RPG
            and solo adventure book audience, but also to offer the regular consumer of audio books
            or fantasy and sci-fi literature an experience beyond what ordinary audio books can
            offer. The game mechanics rely heavily upon the player using their imagination to
            envision what happens in the adventure. This takes mobile gaming beyond tiny screens and
            touch fiddling into new realms — Sound Realms.

          <h1>What is Mace & Magic?</h1>
          <p>
            Mace & Magic is one of Sound Realms’ own series of RPG audio solo adventures. The genre
            is dark fantasy and is set in the “Forsaken Lands of Mihr”, a medieval, more or less
            traditional fantasy world that has been struck by “the Magiklysm”. The Magiklysm was an
            apocalyptic event caused by a war between two guilds of rival sorcerers that has
            completely transformed the world of Mihr into a treacherous and chaotic realm. The
            Magiklysm opened gates to other planes and invoked outerworldly beings and monsters,
            that compete with dragons and more traditional fantasy adversaries. The surviving races
            and nations of Mihr built a fortified city called Decagonia, and this is the center of
            the current civilisation. Surrounding it is only peril and the opportunity for
            adventure! With the Forsaken Lands of Mihr we aim to create a world where more or less
            anything can happen, where the emphasis lies on mysteries and the unique rather than
            orthodox fantasy encounters and events.

          <h1>Why a digital game?</h1>
          <p>
            To digitalise solo RPG rules comes with many advantages. A digital application offers
            far less limitations than a book. We aim to create the adventures so they offer a
            different experience in as many ways possible every time played so they can be replayed
            several times. In time the app will also contain numerous side quests, vast lists of
            treasure and equipment and enormous bestiaries ready to be randomised into the
            adventures using any number of modifications. The team puts a lot of focus into
            exploring in what ways we can develop the app and the take advantage of the fact that it
            is a digital product. The suspense of the voice-overs is unparalleled as they can be
            carefully planned and designed, we also have the option of retakes until we achieve
            perfection. The sound effects and music are also introduced with the exact right timing
            to create the most captivating and dramatic experience possible.
